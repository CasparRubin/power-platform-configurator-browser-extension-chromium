 * Coverage is scoped to modules exercised by unit tests. Entry points (`background`, `content`),

 * primitives are excluded so thresholds reflect logic we test in Node rather than E2E browser
 * targets (those pieces have dedicated tests or are DEV-only / UI glue). Popup layout contracts
 * are guarded by `tests/popup-chrome.test.ts` (source/structure checks). Smaller modules such as
 * `action-badge.ts` stay included (stubbed `chrome` in tests).
